  <H1>The Web & How It Works</H1>
<p>The web is the world's largetst network of computers.  Essentially, it can be best described as a bunch of computers that communicate with each other.</p>
<p>It is mostly make up of a collection of HTML documents; however, any type of file can be linked to the web.  Some other examples of files that can be found on the web are: Plain Text, HTML, Images, Videos, and Music.</p>
<p><b>HTML</b> or Hyper Text Markup Language documents are the main type of content on the web.  HTML documents are made up of:<br>
<blockquote>-  Text Content (what you see)<br>
  -  Markup (what it looks like)<br>
  -  Links to other web pages<br>
  -  References to other documents</blockquote></p>
 <p><b>HTTP</b> is the main protocol of the web.  When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a HTTP request to a server, or computer that hosts the files that makeup the web.  The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser such as FireFox, Internet Explorer, or Chrome interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.  (A webpage is a text document written in HTML.)</p>
  <H3>HTML Jargon</H3>
  <p><b>Tag</b>
  <blockquote>-  Contained in angled brackets<br>
  -  Most have an opening and closing tag</blockquote>
  <p><b>Void Tag</b>
  <br>
  <blockquote>-  Do not require a closing tag because they have no content
  -  Images and page breaks are examples of Void Tags
  </blockquote>
  </b></p><b> Element</b>
  <br>
  <blockquote>-  Refers to everything written within a set of opening and closing tags
  <br>
  -  <b>Inline vs. Block Elements</b>:  Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside them.
  </blockquote>
  <br>
  <b>Attribute</b>
  <br>
  <blockquote>-  Is a property of a HTML element</blockquote>

  <H3>Things to Remember</H3>
  <p>Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand.  The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote.  <b>Computers are stupid.</b>  Computers interpret instructions literally which makes them very unforgiving.  A small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program so programmers must write code <b>exactly</b> exactly the way a computer understands.  (Writing with correct syntax.)
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Programmers cannot remember everything.</b>  There are simply too many details; however, it is very easy to search for and find what you are looking for.
